        Synchronized makes it so if a method that is Synchronized is being run by a thread,
        the method or object that the method is on becomes locked from other threads to use until the thread using it is done with it.
    
        volatile makes it so a veriable that is volatile never gets cached thread-locally and all interactions are made with it through the main memory
        therefor not blocking other threads from using the veriable but still acting as if the veriable is synchronized itself.
